Brackets should be in-line of a function, otherwize it will throw an Compiler Error, because Go Compiler adds a semicolon (;) at
the end of every line.

```
func main (){

}

func main ()       //Thanks God!
{

}

Variables should be defined with the Type after it:

```
var message string = "Hello Go World"

```

We also can define multiple variables at the same line, as well with their vlues:

```
var a,b,c int = 1,2,3
```

It is not required to specify the type of a variable when we are declaring it, the following syntax is valid:
```
var message = "Hello Go World"
```

We can even go a step further and declare a variable without the *var* keyword:
```
message := "Hello Go World"

a,b,c := 1, false, "String!"  //This even works with multiple declaration in one line
```

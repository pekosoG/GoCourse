## HELLO WORLD GO

Code generated by following the Course https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=go&author=john-sonmez&name=go-m2-development


Run
```
#> go run <file-name>
```

Compile
```
#> go build <file-name>
```


Brackets should be in-line of a function, otherwize it will throw an Compiler Error, because Go Compiler adds a semicolon (;) at
the end of every line.

```
func main (){

}

func main ()       //Thanks God!
{

}

#### Variables
---------
Variables should be defined with the Type after it:

```
var message string = "Hello Go World"

```

We also can define multiple variables at the same line, as well with their values:

```
var a,b,c int = 1,2,3
```

It is not required to specify the type of a variable when we are declaring it, the following syntax is valid:
```
var message = "Hello Go World"
```

We can even go a step further and declare a variable without the *var* keyword:

```
message := "Hello Go World"

a,b,c := 1, false, "String!"  //This even works with multiple declaration in one line

```

#### Pointers
----------
Pointers behave as the old fashion C/C++ where:
- they have to be defined as a pointer of the variable type using an asterisk (*)
- you can set/access the actual value of the variable using ampersand (&)
- you can alter the value of the variable using the pointer

```
var someString = "the value"
var *somePointer = &someString  //Setting the pointer

fmt.Println(someString,somePointer)  //This would print something like "the value 0xc42000e1d0"
fmt.Println(someString,&somePointer)  //This would print something like "the value the value"

*somePointer = "hi there"  //We modify the value of the address

fmt.Println(someString,somePointer)  //This would print something like "hi there 0xc42000e1d0"
fmt.Println(someString,&somePointer)  //This would print something like "hi there hi there"

```
